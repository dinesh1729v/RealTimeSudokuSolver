Real-time Sudoku solver: detects the puzzle from a live camera feed, recognizes digits with a CNN, solves the board, and overlays the answers back on the video.

## ‚ú® What it does

- üß† **Digit recognition** via a CNN trained on **Chars74K**.
- üß© **Sudoku grid detection** using OpenCV geometry & contour tricks.
- üî¢ **9√ó9 cell extraction** and per-cell digit classification.
- üßÆ **Fast solving** using a classic algorithm (inspired by Peter Norvig).
- üñäÔ∏è **AR overlay** of missing digits back onto the original frame.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Create a model for digit recognition**  
   - Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the **Chars74K dataset** for digits 0‚Äì9.  
   - Save the trained model as `digitRecognition.h5`.

2. **Detect the Sudoku grid**  
   - Use **OpenCV** to process frames in real time.  
   - Apply grayscale, blur, thresholding, and contour detection to isolate the Sudoku grid.  
   - Use perspective transformation to correct skew.

3. **Divide the grid into 9√ó9 cells**  
   - Split the warped grid image into 81 parts.  
   - Preprocess each cell and feed it into the CNN model to predict digits.  
   - Empty cells are marked as zeros.

4. **Solve the Sudoku puzzle**  
   - Represent the board as a 2D array and fill missing values using a solving algorithm.  
   - Uses **Peter Norvig‚Äôs Sudoku solver** .

5. **Overlay the solution**  
   - Using **OpenCV**, write the solved digits back onto the frame.  
   - Display the augmented frame in real time with the completed puzzle.
